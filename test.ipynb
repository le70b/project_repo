    "            ### Setting Up Streamlit with Anaconda Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "            Anaconda is a powerful platform for Python and R languages, simplifying package management and deployment. By using Anaconda, you can create isolated environments to run different projects, ensuring that dependencies do not interfere with each other. Here's how to set up Streamlit within an Anaconda environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 1. **Install Anaconda**:\n",
    "            If you haven't installed Anaconda yet, download and install it from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 2. **Create a New Environment**:\n",
    "            After installation, open the Anaconda Navigator or the terminal (on Linux/Mac) or command prompt (on Windows) and create a new environment using the following command:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            conda create --name streamlit_env python=3.8\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            Replace `streamlit_env` with your desired environment name and `3.8` with your preferred Python version, if different.\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 3. **Activate the Environment**:\n",
    "            To use the new environment, you need to activate it:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            conda activate streamlit_env\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 4. **Install Streamlit**:\n",
    "            With the environment activated, install Streamlit using pip:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip install streamlit\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 5. **Running Streamlit Apps**:\n",
    "            Now, you can run any Streamlit app within this environment. For example, to run the default Streamlit app, use:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            streamlit hello\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 6. **Deactivate the Environment**:\n",
    "            Once you're done working with Streamlit, you can deactivate the Anaconda environment:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            conda deactivate\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            By following this setup, you ensure that Streamlit and its dependencies are contained within a specific Anaconda environment, preventing any potential conflicts with other Python projects or libraries.\n",

    "            ### Managing and Installing Python Libraries in Streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "            In the world of Python and Streamlit, libraries are collections of functions and methods that allow you to perform actions without writing your own code. Sometimes, to run a Streamlit app, you'll need to install specific libraries. Here's how you can do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 1. **Installing Libraries**:\n",
    "            You can install required libraries using `pip`, the package installer for Python. Simply open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip install library-name\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            For instance, to install Streamlit, you'd use:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip install streamlit\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 2. **Saving Library Versions for Sharing**:\n",
    "            If you're developing a Streamlit app that you intend to share with others, it's crucial to ensure that everyone uses the same versions of libraries to avoid compatibility issues. Here's how to save and share your library versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - First, save the versions of all libraries you have installed in a file called `requirements.txt` using this command:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            - When someone else needs to run your Streamlit app, they can install the exact versions of the required libraries using:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "\n",
    "            This approach ensures that everyone has the necessary libraries at the correct versions to run your Streamlit app seamlessly!\n",
    "\n",
    "            ### 3. **Running this Streamlit App**:\n",
    "            First, clone the [github repository](https://github.com/hawk-li/fcs-streamlit-intro) or download and extract the zip file containing this Streamlit app. Then, navigate to the directory containing this Streamlit app using the terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "            Make sure you have created and activated a new Anaconda environment as described in the previous section.\n",
    "            ```bash\t\n",
    "            cd path/to/streamlit-tutorial\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            Second, install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            Then, run this Streamlit app using:\n",
    "            ```bash\n",
    "            streamlit run app.py\n",
    "            ```\n",
